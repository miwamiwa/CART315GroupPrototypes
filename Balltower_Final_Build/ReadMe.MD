Ball Tower - Final Build
============================================================
In this game you must find your dog who is running loose on a floor full of balls​​. 
Jump, whistle, and blast balls out of the way to locate your favorite fella before time runs out! 
You can also collect arrow crates that will temporarily point you towards your doggo. 
Each time you reach your dog, the platform falls and a new level start with more balls hiding your dog from view. Enjoy!​

CONTROLS: [WASD] to move, [SPACE] to jump, [P] to whistle, [O] to powermove.

Developped by Melissa Lim and Samuel Paré-Chouinard

CHANGES

In this final iteration of Ball Tower, we made four main changes:
- adding a timer to the game that the user can extend by finding the dog. This change and the next were meant to addess comments about users feeling like the game lacked pressure of some kind. 
- adding an end screen when the final level is reached. 
- fixing sound priorities so that the user can still whistle when the ball sounds over
- adding some strength to the power move as the game progresses in order for it to feel a bit more useful in later levels. By the end of the game, the balls become difficult to navigate regardless, which is the desired effect.
